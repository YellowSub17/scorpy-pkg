 Command line parameters: agno3-d03_means -a50000 -b3000 -c624 -g0 -m0 -t8

 -a sets the approximate maximum number of atoms including hydrogens.
 -b sets the maximum number of full-matrix parameters (not used by CGLS).
 For example -b9000 allows refinement of 1000 anisotropic atoms or 3000
 with BLOC 1. For a 32-bit version, -b times the square root of the
 number of threads should not exceed about 65500. -c sets the reflection
 buffer size. This depends on the CPU cache size but will rarely
 need changing.

 -g sets the number of reflection groups used for calculating R_complete,
 This must be greater than 1 but not greater than the total number of
 reflections for refinement. -m sets the current reflection group number.
 This may not be less than 1 nor greater than the number set by -g. These
 command line flags override other ways of defining free-R reflections.
 The -m value is also used as a seed for the WIGL pseudo-random shifts.

 -t sets the number of threads, otherwise it is set to the apparent
 number of CPUs. For optimal performance on hyperthreading systems,
 -t should be set to a little more than half the number of CPUs;
 e.g. -t4 or -t5 for an Intel i7 processor.
